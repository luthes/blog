I'll be graduating June of 2017 from the University of Washington Tacoma,
majoring in Information Technology. After graduation I'll be working at The
Walt Disney Company as a Junior DevOps Engineer.

### More Information

I'm really interested in building scalable systems that are extremely resilient,
with no downtime using cloud infrastructure.
